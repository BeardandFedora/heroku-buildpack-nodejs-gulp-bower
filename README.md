Heroku Buildpack for Node.js, gulp.js, and bower
========================================

Usage
-----

- Set your Heroku app's buildpack URL to `https://github.com/BeardandFedora/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-gulp-bower`. To be safe, you should really fork this and use your fork's URL.
- Run `heroku labs:enable user-env-compile` to enable environment variable support
- Run `heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production` to set your environment to `production` (or any other name)
- Add a Gulp task called `heroku:production` that builds your app

- Add a single line `Procfile` to the root to serve the app via node:

```
web: node server.js
```

## How it Works

Apps are built via one of four paths:

1. A regular `npm install` (first build; default scenario)
2. Copy existing `node_modules` from cache, then `npm prune`, then `npm install` (subsequent builds)
3. Skip dependencies (if package.json doesn't exist but server.js does)
4. Skip cache, run `npm rebuild` before `npm install` (`node_modules` are checked into source control)

You should only use #3 (omitting package.json) for quick tests or experiments.

You should never use #4 - it's included for backwards-compatibility and will generate warnings.
**Checking in `node_modules` is an antipattern.**
For more information, see [the npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/faq#should-i-check-my-node_modules-folder-into-git-)

## Legacy Compatibility

For most Node.js apps this buildpack should work just fine.
If, however, you're unable to deploy using this new version of the buildpack, you can get your app working again by locking it to the previous version:

```
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/BeardandFedora/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-gulp-bower#v63 -a my-app
git commit -am "empty" --allow-empty
git push heroku master
```

Then please open a support ticket at [help.heroku.com](https://help.heroku.com/) so we can diagnose and get your app running on the default buildpack.

## Options

### Specify a node version

Set engines.node in package.json to the semver range
(or specific version) of node you'd like to use.
(It's a good idea to make this the same version you use during development)

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "0.11.x"
}
```

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "0.10.33"
}
```

Default: the
[latest stable version.](http://semver.io/node)

### Specify an npm version

Set engines.npm in package.json to the semver range
(or specific version) of npm you'd like to use.
(It's a good idea to make this the same version you use during development)

Since 'npm 2' shipped several major bugfixes, you might try:

```json
"engines": {
  "npm": "2.x"
}
```

```json
"engines": {
  "npm": "^2.1.0"
}
```

Default: the version of npm bundled with your node install (varies).

### Enable or disable node_modules caching

For a 'clean' build without using any cached node modules:

```shell
heroku config:set NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false
git commit -am 'rebuild' --allow-empty
git push heroku master
heroku config:unset NODE_MODULES_CACHE
```

Caching node_modules between builds dramatically speeds up build times.
However, `npm install` doesn't automatically update already-installed modules
as long as they fall within acceptable semver ranges,
which can lead to outdated modules.

Default: `NODE_MODULES_CACHE` defaults to true

### Enable or disable devDependencies installation

During local development, `npm install` installs all dependencies
and all devDependencies (test frameworks, build tools, etc).
This is usually something you want to avoid in production, so
npm has a 'production' config that can be set through the environment:

To install *dependencies only:*

```shell
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=true
```

To install *dependencies and devDependencies:*

```shell
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

Default: `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` defaults to true on Heroku

### Configure npm with .npmrc

Sometimes, a project needs custom npm behavior to set up proxies,
use a different registry, etc. For such behavior,
just include an `.npmrc` file in the root of your project:

```
# .npmrc
registry = 'https://custom-registry.com/'
```

### Chain Node with multiple buildpacks

This buildpack automatically exports node, npm, and any node_modules binaries
into the `$PATH` for easy use in subsequent buildpacks.

## Hacking

To make changes to this buildpack, fork it on Github. Push up changes to your fork, then create a new Heroku app to test it, or configure an existing app to use your buildpack:

```
# Create a new Heroku app that uses your buildpack
heroku create --buildpack <your-github-url>

# Configure an existing Heroku app to use your buildpack
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=<your-github-url>

# You can also use a git branch!
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=<your-github-url>#your-branch
```

## Testing

[Anvil](https://github.com/ddollar/anvil) is a generic build server for Heroku.

```
gem install anvil-cli
```

The [heroku-anvil CLI plugin](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-anvil) is a wrapper for anvil.

```
heroku plugins:install https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-anvil
```

The [ddollar/test](https://github.com/ddollar/buildpack-test) buildpack runs `bin/test` on your app/buildpack.

```
heroku build -b ddollar/test # -b can also point to a local directory
```

For more info on testing, see [Best Practices for Testing Buildpacks](https://discussion.heroku.com/t/best-practices-for-testing-buildpacks/294) on the Heroku discussion forum.
